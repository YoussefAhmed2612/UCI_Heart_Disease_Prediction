# ❤️ UCI Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a **Streamlit web app** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. It uses the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset (Cleveland subset)** and machine learning models built with **Scikit-learn**.

---

## 🔍 About the Project
- Input clinical data such as **age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type**, and more.  
- The model predicts **0 = No Disease** or **1 = Disease Present**.  
- Built to demonstrate how **machine learning can be applied in healthcare**.
